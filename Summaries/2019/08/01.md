### [A](https://ac.nowcoder.com/acm/contest/885/A)
> You are given a positive integer n which is at most 100.
> Please find a positive integer satisfying the following conditions:
> 1. The sum of all digits of this number is dividable by n.
> 2. This number is also dividable by n.
> 3. This number contains no more than 10<sup>4</sup> digits.
>
> If such an integer doesn't exist, output "Impossible" (without quotation marks).
If there are multiple such integers, please output any one.

* Think more, do not depend much on Python or brute force for the first time. Except for the case, we think some regular pattern may exist.

### [B](https://ac.nowcoder.com/acm/contest/885/B)
> You are given four positive integers x<sub>0</sub>,x<sub>1</sub>,a,b. And you know x<sub>i</sub>=a⋅x<sub>i−1</sub>+b⋅x<sub>i−2</sub>​ for all i≥2.
> Given two positive integers n, and MOD, please calculate x<sub>n</sub>​ modulo MOD.
> Does the problem look simple? Surprise! The value of n may have many many digits!
输入描述：
> The input contains two lines.
> The first line contains four integers x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>,a,b (1 ≤ x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, a, b ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).
> The second line contains two integers n, MOD (1≤n<10<sup>10<sup>6</sup></sup>,10<sup>9</sup> < MOD ≤ 2×10<sup>9</sup>, n has no leading zero).

* Too more MOD may cause TLE
* 数的降幂与矩阵的降幂并无直接关系
